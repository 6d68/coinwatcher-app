# coinwatcher (App)

Just a small project to get familiar with the React.js ecosystem. Here i'm using React Native to create a native mobile app to collect informations like market prices or trends of crypto currencies e.g. BitCoin or Ethereum. The [backend (coinwatcher-backend)](https://github.com/6d68/coinwatcher-backend) is implemented via Serverless and uses AWS with DynamoDB and Lambda.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React Native App](https://github.com/react-community/create-react-native-app).
